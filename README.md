# OnlinShop
This is my first ever project (UG - Nov 2019)
This is a my project which I completed in my 5th sem of my graduation. 
This a Web based Online Shopping System Developed using HTML, JavaScript on Oracle Express Database (through Apache Tomcat virtual Server).
The connection of front end web pages to back end Database was committed via jdbc class.


# The pages...
Page1 is the login page... one can login as a user... and admins can login as admin
# Admin pages
Page2 takes in admin id and password.
Page3 allows admins to modulate(add, delete etc.) items in the database.
# User pages
Page2 takes user id an password
page 3 shows a pool of items to buy and a overhead menu of cart, profile, orders etc just as some standard online shopping system

# index.html is the very 1st page of this project

# Screenshots.pdf gives the sample views of the back end database.
